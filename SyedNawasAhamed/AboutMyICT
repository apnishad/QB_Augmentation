Project Overview 
	This ICT Project contains development of web application to automate Generic Sales and billing application. 
  Any retail shop can use this application in generic way and they can maintain Products information and can perform billing operations. 
  The Retail outlet has to feed all the products information first before making bills.
Initial Assumptions:
	To reduce the size of the application, there are no stock maintenance and purchase modules. 
Future Enhancements:
As future enhancement we can update this project to support product purchasing and stock management modules as extra.
